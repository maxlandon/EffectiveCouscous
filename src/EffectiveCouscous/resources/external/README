This package directory is used to store non-Canari transform code. Why would you want to use for Canari? For easy
transform distribution. You can use Canari as a transform proxy to execute your non-Python or non-Canari transform code.
This allows you to package up your transforms in an easy-to-use transform package and easily share the package with your
colleagues.
